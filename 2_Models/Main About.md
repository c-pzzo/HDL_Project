I want to compare the performance of various classical and modern ML methods against DL method to sustain or refute the superiority of a complex DL model for multi-step forecasts. 

These classical models will serve as benchmarks to compare the accuracy of ML methods versus alternative ones.

As a response, the study includes eight classical methods and (10) machine learning methods evaluated using one-step and multiple-step forecasts across a collection of (1,045 monthly) time series. Although not definitive, the results are intended to be objective and robust

Relevant too is to identify single-step forecasts.


Simple time series:
The study provides important supporting evidence that classical methods may dominate uni-
variate time series forecasting, at least on the types of forecasting problems evaluated. The
study demonstrates the worse performance and the increase in computational cost of machine
learning and deep learning methods for univariate time series forecasting for both one-step and
multi-step forecasts.

 Classical methods like ETS and ARIMA out-perform machine learning and deep learning methods for one-step forecasting on univariate datasets.
 Classical methods like Theta and ARIMA out-perform machine learning and deep learning methods for multi-step forecasting on univariate datasets.
 Machine learning and deep learning methods do not yet deliver on their promise for univariate time series forecasting and there is much work to do.

----> This study will look at more complex time series problems.
